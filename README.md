The app functionality is to store your ideas for all your next trips.

Write your next trip destination name in the input. The app will take you to the form then, where you can leave a picture of the destination and write acctivities to do there or specific places to see.  

All trips will be remembered for your device.

If you just want to see quickly what the app offers, you could try it with prepared sample plans. 
You can do this setting a cookie in your console:
